# Drop-seq Data Analysis

This repository features workflow for data analysis of DroNc-seq Data[(Habib et al., 2017)]( https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4407). `dropseq_minimal.Rmd` takes you through minimal example of processing in `R`,mainly using [Seurat](http://satijalab.org/seurat/). The `dropseq.Rmd` and the associated PDF document then give full recipe of bioinformatical workflow starting from FASTQ files and going all the way to plotting in `R`.

## Getting Started

* To run the minimal example, you will need to download [some files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zwaqjk-cewYEuSwPbsBbacN5HBGktVOx/view?usp=sharing).

* The script for the full analysis cannot be executed due to the volume of necessary data. Instead, it serves as a guide for developing a workflow of your own.

### Prerequisites

Described in the PDF.
